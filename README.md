# Bootstrap Portfolio (Trilogy Skills Bootcamp: Week 3)

> **NOTE:** I included my name in the Navbar instead of the Jumbotron as it appears cleaner, and they share the same area of the page.

> **NOTE:** I have no hyperlinks or buttons in the "Footer" section as there is no real content for me to link to, therefore I have included the `All hyperlinks should have a hover effect` and `All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover` features elsewhere on the page to meet the acceptance criteria.
